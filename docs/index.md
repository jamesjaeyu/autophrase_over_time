# Introduction
Phrase mining is the process of utilizing automated programs for extracting important and high-quality phrases from bodies of text. These phrases can be used in a variety of ways, from extracting major ideas from customer reviews or key points from a scientific paper. However, phrase mining has historically been done with complicated linguistic analyzers trained on specific data, meaning that it is difficult to expand to a larger scope without significant additional human effort. As a way to mine phrases in an expandable way, in any language or domain, AutoPhrase was created. With AutoPhrase, it is possible to input any text corpora without the need for human labels, allowing for much faster extraction of phrases in a variety of documents.

With that in mind, we utilized AutoPhrase to extract the phrases from a database of 3,079,007 computer science research papers aggregated from 1950 to 2017. With this, we can trace the evolution of key ideas through the history of computer science, as well as find which ideas were most common in what years. Additionally, we used the extracted phrases as data to construct a classification model for finding what year a paper belongs to based on its key phrases as a way of showing how strong the connections are between ideas and time.
